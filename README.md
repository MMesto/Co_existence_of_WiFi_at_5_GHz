# Co_existence_of_WiFi_at_5_GHz
Abstractâ€”Increased number of technologies which use the same unlicensed frequency spectrum often cause severe degradation in the performance of these technologies. In this paper we will discuss the technologies that use the 5GHz frequency band. More and more participating technologies in the 5GHz band cause interference with each other which causes the corresponding technologies to face lower performance in their normal operation. We will discuss the possible challenges we face and their solutions in the coordination of WiFi operating at different frequencies e.g WiFi at 2.4GHz and WiFi at 5GHz. We further discuss the challenges and their solutions in the coexistence of WiFi at 5GHz with LTE-U and LAA. Wherein we will discuss also the deployment of LTE technologies coexisting with WiFi technologies in the unlicensed spectrum 5 GHz. Listen before talk (LBT) functionality is required in unlicensed band in order to ensure the fair coexistence among different operators. We propose a LBT enhancement algorithm with contention window size adaptation for LTE with Licensed-Assisted Access (LTE-LAA) in order to achieve not only channel access fairness but also the QoS fairness. In the last part of the paper we explore further to discuss the cross technology communication which enables distinct participating technologies to effectively communicate with each other to optimize the performance.
